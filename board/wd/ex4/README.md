# WD My Cloud EX4 board support

This directory is reserved for board-specific Buildroot support: kernel and
bootloader configuration fragments, device-tree work, root-filesystem overlay,
post-build scripts, image assembly, and recovery documentation.

Known discovery baseline:

- vendor firmware 2.13.108;
- Linux 3.2.40;
- ARMv5/Feroceon-class CPU;
- approximately 512 MiB RAM;
- raw NAND containing U-Boot, kernel, ramdisk, main image, rescue firmware,
  persistent config, and reserve partitions.

These facts are not sufficient to build or flash an image. Before board support
is enabled, determine CPU/SoC identity, RAM map, UART parameters, NAND geometry,
ECC/OOB layout, bad-block behaviour, Ethernet/SATA/USB controllers, GPIOs,
fan/thermal control, LEDs, buttons, watchdog, RTC, and bootloader environment.

Initial bring-up must boot from RAM, TFTP, or another non-persistent path.

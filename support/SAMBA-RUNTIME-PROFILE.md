# Samba restricted-root QEMU profile

This is a **test-only experiment**, not a product runtime manifest, installed
helper, activation permission or EX4 qualification. It is separate from the
generic static non-root launcher, which remains unchanged. Do not run it on
physical hardware or connect user data.

## Reproduce locally

With an existing pinned Buildroot image/workspace and manifest-verified QEMU
artifacts, run `support/test-samba-root.ps1`. The wrapper refuses missing caches;
it never builds/pulls an image or creates a named volume. Source, workspace and
base inputs are read-only; one disposable container uses bounded 512 MiB `/tmp`
and 128 MiB `/var/tmp` tmpfs. Compiler scratch is removed before the image copy.
One ARM926/VersatilePB boot is bounded to 180 seconds, without retries, guest
NICs, host ports or physical-device attachments. The base image hash must remain
unchanged. Generated images and state are destroyed when the fixture exits.

## What the experiment does

- Derives non-authorizing ELF candidates for three fixed public Buildroot
  programs: `smbd`, `smbpasswd`, `testparm`. Merging refuses conflicts, unknown
  paths, missing entries, partial graphs or asserted execution authority.
- Inside the guest, verifies every selected SHA-256 and canonical alias before
  copying regular ELFs and generating symlinks into a root-controlled tmpfs.
  The ordinary target filesystem and original image remain read-only.
- Creates only fixture-owned Unix account/group files and passdb. The profile
  uses standalone SMB3 with required signing, three separate accounts, local
  file-based NSS, no guest, DNS, AD, arbitrary includes or dynamic VFS plugins.
  Password setup is a disposable test setup, not the product identity Owner.
- A fixed ARM/VersatilePB-guarded native fixture creates a private mount
  namespace and restricted root. Only declared subdirectories and fixture state
  are bound into it. The runtime root is read-only; shares use
  `nosuid,nodev,noexec` and the read-only grant is verified in the kernel.
- Samba retains UID 0 for its native per-client Unix identity/group switches.
  Effective, permitted and bounding capabilities are exactly `0xdb`:
  `CHOWN`, `DAC_OVERRIDE`, `FOWNER`, `FSETID`, `SETGID`, `SETUID`.
  Ambient/inheritable sets are zero and `no_new_privs` is set. There is no
  `SYS_ADMIN`, `SYS_CHROOT`, `PTRACE`, `SETPCAP` or network-administration grant.
  Extra FDs are closed before exec; no host directory/device handle is retained.
- The guest independently checks the live parent capability sets, NNP, root
  and distinct mount namespace. Original storage paths, `/proc` and block nodes
  are absent. A direct create on the read-only grant must return `EROFS`.
- Real SMB3 clients require writer ownership `1801:1800`, reader success,
  password/outsider denial, Unix-mode denial on a writable but root-only share,
  write denial through the kernel read-only grant, original-anchor denial and
  symlink denial with no residual files. One accented/Greek filename roundtrip
  is checked; it is not a complete encoding/normalization campaign.
- Fixed client operations have a native ten-second deadline; timeout/signal
  exits cannot count as access denials. The native wrapper accepts no arbitrary
  executable, hostname, credential pathname or SMB command.
- Stop signals only the fixture-created group, waits for the parent and requires
  the group to disappear. BusyBox may report the requested SIGTERM as status143;
  that is accepted only after group absence. Other outcomes fail. There is no
  stop retry or forced-success fallback, and no crash/durability claim.

## Boundaries still missing

The fixture's fixed paths, state and Unix IDs are not a production constructor
or resolver. It does not use production mount/identity Owners, persistent
transactions, process-set integration, session revocation or operator recovery.
It does not prove resistance to concurrent runtime-root replacement, all root
escape mechanisms, syscall attacks or credential/ACL migrations. A private
mount namespace plus limited root is not a security certification.

Samba's source supports configuration-selected `dlopen` modules; the pinned
target contains 39 VFS modules. This deliberately small baseline does not
qualify `acl_xattr`, Windows ACL preservation, streams, recycle or other plugins.
The public target lacks the CP850 conversion module and logs an ASCII fallback;
the observed SMB3 UTF-8 case does not resolve that separate compatibility gap.
Quota observations on disposable tmpfs are not RAID/storage-health evidence.
Do not change encodings or silently relax legacy ACLs to mask missing runtime.

Next qualify the required dynamic modules/conversions and explicit configuration,
state, socket and privilege contract; construct roots from trusted pinned inputs
and Owner-held grants; then integrate service-specific supervision and recovery.
Product startup and all physical-device safety/migration/install gates remain
closed. Kernel NFS authority is a separate design, not granted by this experiment.
